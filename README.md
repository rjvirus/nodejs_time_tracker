You can use this by downloading the zip file.

First, we need to run npm install to get all the libraries
Secondly, we need to run 'npm run start' in terminal to run the server

Server usually loads in localhost:4000

Also we have to make sure npm and node is installed in the system before running this app.

Express JS is used to setup routes for request in the application.

Improvements that can be made :-

1. Error handling could be much better.
2. Implementation of search and pagination query in one single request could be effective for effective communication between client and server.
3. Proper response with HTTP status codes can be effective for client to understand what could be the issue for the failure.
